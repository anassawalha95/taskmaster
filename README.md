## Documentation

### May 16 :

- Created a new directory and repo to hold the app, named taskmaster.
- Created three pages with very basic layout - homepage, add a task, all tasks.
- The homepage has two buttons, one which allows the user to go to the Add Task view, and the other that allows the user to go to the All Tasks view.
- Added a task page that allows users to type in a title and a body for their task.
